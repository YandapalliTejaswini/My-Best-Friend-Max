<hr style="width:30%;">


<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:40px; margin-bottom:30px;">Every morning, Max would eagerly greet the children waiting for their school bus. His tail would wag furiously, and his warm, brown

 eyes sparkled with delight as he accepted their morning pats and treats. Max had an uncanny ability to sense when someone needed comfort. If a neighbor was 

feeling down, he'd trot over with a toy or simply sit by their side, offering a sympathetic presence. Max's best friend was a young boy named Jack. They were 

inseparable, embarking on countless adventures together in the nearby woods. Jack would often confide in Max, sharing his dreams and fears, knowing that Max  

would never judge or betray his secrets. Their bond was unbreakable.</p>
